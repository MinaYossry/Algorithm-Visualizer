# Algorithm Visualizer
This project is an interactive web-based application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time. The user can select from bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. The application allows the user to generate a random array, enter their own array, and adjust the speed of the animation. The application displays the pseudocode for each sorting algorithm and a graph of the sorting process.

This project is created as a part of JavaScript and jQuery courses in ITI 9-Month Scholarship Program.
